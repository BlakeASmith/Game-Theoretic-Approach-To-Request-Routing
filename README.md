# A Game Theoretic Approach To Request Routing

Completed as a final project for MATH 377, Mathematical Modelling, at the University of Victoria (Fall 2021).

## Problem

A popular conference has installed a number of displays, with connected computers, which will show live updates
about ongoing events and developments for the conference. In order to acheive this, the display computers 
poll a server for data on a fixed interval. It is important for the organizers that the displays stay as closely 
synchronized as possible. 

In the planning of the next years conference, the organizers have a limited budget to purches additional displays and server
computers. Ideally, they would like to have displays in all availible locations in the venue, since this would keep as many attendees as 
possible up to date with the current events. As such, the organizers would like to know:

1. What is the minimum number of server machines required in order to serve the complete set of displays?
2. What is the optimal placement of the machines within the venue?
3. Which server should each display computer route their requests to?
